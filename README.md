This is The Game.
===
I call it that way, because it still doesn't have a name. But what it has is CODE. A LOT of it.

Well, not that much, if you think about it. But still, it's the biggest project I've created in a while.
A long while.
It involves a cube... A loving cube searching for it's love.
YOU are this cube. Or maybe it's all about me. So you may as well think that I am this cube.
My digital identity, if you like.


But why?
---
This idea have been in my mind for approximately 3 years.
For the first time (3 years ago) I was trying to write it in C++, but it was too hard.
Also, my PC crashed, deleting all I've created, so don't think I'm just lazy and afraid of challenges.
It was all about those thoughts that I have to rewrite ALL of the code for the second time, it made me sick.
But now it doesn't seem so scary anymore, so I've decided to give it another shot.


Why chose I Lua?
---
Well, I'm just lazy, you got me. ;)
But is the laziness a bad thing?
Keeping it at the maintainable level meets the KISS principle, which is even better.
Also, I don't need heavy-ten-ton-hammer C++ is.
For the small, simple game I'm creating, Lua seemed to me as a perfect solution.
I wasn't wrong. Thanks to dynamic nature of this language and duck typing, 
it will be much simpler to implement few things I struggled using C++.


I want to help you. May I?
---
Of course. That's what the open source is about. 

I may use any possible help. 
If you have interesting and moving music that will fit into the game, 
if you want to help creating graphics or tweak anything in the code or maps, 
or even if you just want to comment out anything, I'd be really greatful.


Where to start?
---
At `main.lua`. There you will find a `Game` object - simple manager of any active objects drawn 
or listening to keys pressed. There's no point of explaining any other files though. 
Code changes so much it will be cumbersome to change README with every commit.
